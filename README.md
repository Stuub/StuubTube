# StuubTube

A browser extension, automating the process of blocking ads on YouTube using YouTube's own Ad Center functionality.

## Installation


StuubTube isn't available on official extension stores. Here's how to install it manually:

## Chrome

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder.
5. StuubTube should now appear in your extensions list.

## Usage

Once installed, StuubTube will automatically attempt to block ads on YouTube videos. You can toggle it on/off by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

Additionally, a tracker of your total adverts blocked since using the extension will also be counted :)

## How it Works
The extension essentially automates steps that can be done manually, but saves you that effort in these steps:

1. Detects when an ad is playing.
2. Opens YouTube's Ad Center.
3. Clicks "Block ad".
4. Confirms the action.
5. Closes the Ad Center.

## Limitations

- YouTube may change its Ad Center functionality, which could break StuubTube.

- This extension is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with YouTube. Despite this, it only uses a method available to any user on any device without thr extension.
