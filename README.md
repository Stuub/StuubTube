## Usage

Once installed, StuubTube will automatically attempt to block ads on YouTube videos. You can toggle it on/off by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar.

Additionally, a tracker of your total adverts blocked since using the extension will also be counted :)

## How it Works

1. Detects when an ad is playing.
2. Opens YouTube's Ad Center.
3. Clicks "Block ad".
4. Confirms the action.
5. Closes the Ad Center.
